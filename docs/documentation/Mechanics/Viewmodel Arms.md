!!! note
    Aspects of this feature may be subject to change

HDTF supports seperate arms from the viewmodels akin to L4D, Garry's mod and CSGO with some slight differences and requirements.

## Using arms with weapons

As the transition from the old HL2 style v_models will take time, by default weapons do not have any arm models attached. To attach arms the associated weapon script requires a `uses_arms` entry set to `1`.

```
// Example using scripts/weapon_knife.txt
WeaponData
{
	"printname"	"#HDTF_KNIFE"
	"viewmodel"				"models/weapons/v_knife.mdl"
	"playermodel"			"models/weapons/w_knife.mdl"
    ...
    "uses_arms"  "1"
    ...
}
```

## Specifying arms per map

If a map needs to use a specific arm type it must be specified in the map itself. To do this open the map in Hammer, then on the Menu bar go to `Map` â†’ `Map Properties`, and change the option `Arms Skin` to the desired type.

```
"Arms Skin"
[    
    0 : "Default" - Marine outfit seen in Prologue & Act 1.
    1 : "Jacket" - black jacket with leather gloves seen in Act 3.
    2 : "Snow coat" - white coat seen in Act 2.
    3 : "Bare" - bare hands as seen in Tutorial level.
]
```

## Console Commands

- `cl_disable_arms` - Setting this to 1 will disable drawing the arm model.
- `hdtf_set_arms_type` - Setting this to a value from 0 to 3 will change the current arm type being used. Uses the same ordering found in the map properties setting.
