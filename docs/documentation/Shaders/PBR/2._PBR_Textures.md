# PBR Textures
PBR Textures should follow some guidelines.
Important note :
Using VTFedit ( for example ) for converting textures does not allow you to use 16b/c textures, at all!
When converting a 16b/c 

## For all Textures
If you use compressed Ported Formats ( .vtf image formats ), export your textures as the next power of 2 and then clamp downwards. This will make the end result look less compressed ( speaking from experience )

## $BaseTexture
BaseColor of the material.

Export Format ( when export from Substance for example ) should be :
 - 8 bits/channel source format ( Just use .tif 16b/c for everything )
 - sRGB ( non-linear )
 sRGB8 is the default format for BaseColor in Substance Painter.
 
Ported Format ( when imported to .vtf )
 - sRGB flag when importing
 - Preferably format that is 8 b/c
( Don't use formats such as rgba16161616f, rgba16161616 )
 Other formats will just waste Disk-space, basically.

## $NormalTexture / $BumpMap
Also known as Normal Map.
Export Format ( when export from Substance for example ) should be :
 - Just do whatever, but export as 16b/c. ( just use .tif at 16b/c )

Ported Format ( when imported to .vtf )
 - DirectX Normal Map Directions.
 ( Turns out that Textures.com Normals are OpenGL Format  )
  If your format is OpenGL, just flip the green channel ( 1.0f - Green Channel, or er ctrl + i in Photoshop )
  If you don't know what any of this means, you should learn what it means via **search engine here**
 - VTF Normal Map flag.
 This does some wacky stuff regarding mip-maps, just do it, don't question it.
 Normal maps should be flagged as such?? Big surprise!
 - .Preferably use BGR565, unless alpha channel is needed or the file is too large...
 ## $MRAOTexture
 

    Red		=	Metallic
    Green	=	Roughness
    Blue	=	Ambient Occlusion

Export Format ( when export from Substance for example ) should be :
 - 8 or 16 bits/channel source format ( Just use .tif 16b/c for everything )
 
Ported Format ( when imported to .vtf )
 - Preferably not compressed. But when compressed, BGR565
 
 Suggestions :
 - Use BGR565 for Rough Materials with low/no Metallic  That is because
   in this format, the Channel including Roughness will have least
   compression and it will make the file the smallest, whilst still
   looking very HQ
 - Preferably don't use Formats with preserved Alpha Channels ( RGBA8888 or DXT5 )
 

## $EmissionTexture
Additive Self-Illumination of the material.
If you want resulting bloom, the $BaseTexture must be non-black.

Export Format ( when export from Substance for example ) should be :
 - 8 bits/channel source format ( Just use .tif 16b/c for everything )
 - sRGB ( non-linear )
 sRGB8 is the default format for Emissive Substance Painter.
 
Ported Format ( when imported to .vtf )
 - sRGB flag when importing
 - Preferably format that is 8 b/c, and compressed ( DXT5 )
( Don't use formats such as rgba16161616f, rgba16161616 )
 Other formats will just waste Disk-space, basically.

## $SSSTEXTURE
Thickness Map and Color Texture for **Models**.

    Red		=	Thickness
    Green	=	Red		Channel of desired SSS-Color
    Blue	=	Green	Channel of desired SSS-Color
    Alpha	=	Blue	Channel of desired SSS-Color
Now hold on a second, this might look a bit odd, why is Thickness on the Red Channel instead of Alpha?
Glad you asked!
Using advanced statistical analysis on the probability of Blue Color in Sub-Surface Scattering.
( We tried to come up with things that are blue and have Subsurface Scattering )
We determined that... Blue is not all that likely... I mean... Blue Mushrooms, Butterflies... Duh?!
By saying RIP to alpha ( blue color in an SSS-Texture ),
you may be able to use compressed formats such as BGR565 or preferably DXT1!
This was done as a diskspace saving measure.
If your SSS Texture only has Thickness and Blue color, you may use a format such as IA88
Just make sure to set $SSSTint to "[0 0 1]" otherwise it will interpret thickness for Red and Green Color.


Export Format ( when export from Substance for example ) should be :
 - 16 bits/channel source format ( Just use .tif 16b/c for everything )
 - Linear Data
This is very important, because the blue channel of the color is in the alpha channel.
Alpha Channels will **not** get converted from Gamma to Linear, so sRGB is out of the question. 
 
Ported Format ( when imported to .vtf )
 - DXT1 or BGR565 ( if less compression is desired ) for when there is no blue
 - DXT5 for when there is blue
 - Preferably format that is 8 b/c, and compressed ( DXT1 - DXT5, BGR565 )
( Don't use formats such as rgba16161616f, rgba16161616 )
 Other formats will just waste Disk-space, basically.
 
## $BentNormal
Bent Normal Map.
Export Format ( when export from Substance or Marmoset ) should be :
 - Tangent Space Normal Map. ( This can be done via Substance or Marmoset Toolbag )
 - Linear Data
 - Just use .tif, hope you learned that by now
 - If you can somehow include usual Normal Map data in this, don't. ( Do tell us that its possible? )

Ported Format ( when imported to .vtf )

 - BGR565, or higher res DXT1
 - Flag as Normal Map...

## $PropertiesTexture
Wetness/Porosity Masking Texture, that also includes mask and roughness from the $VectorLayerTexture. 

    Red		=	Wetness Mask
    Green	=	Porosity Mask
    Blue	=	VectorLayer Mask
    Alpha	=	VectorLayer Roughness
 Export Format ( when export from Substance or Marmoset ) should be :
 - Linear Data
 
 Ported Format ( when imported to .vtf )
 - BGR565, or higher res DXT1 when no VectorLayer Data.
 - RGBA8888 when VectorLayer Data **and** Wetness/Porosity Data
 - IA88 when VectorLayer Data **but no** Wetness/Porosity Data 

## $VectorLayerTexture
    RGB		=	VectorLayer Color
    Alpha	=	VectorLayer AO
Export Format ( when export from Substance or Marmoset ) should be :
 - 8 bits/channel source format ( Just use .tif 16b/c for everything )
 - sRGB ( non-linear )

Ported Format ( when imported to .vtf )
 - sRGB flag when importing
 - Preferably format that is 8 b/c, and compressed ( DXT5 )
( Don't use formats such as rgba16161616f, rgba16161616 )
 Other formats will just waste Disk-space, basically.
