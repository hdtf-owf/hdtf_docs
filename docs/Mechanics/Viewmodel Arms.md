# Viewmodel Arms

!!! note
    Aspects of this feature may be subject to change

HDTF supports seperate arms from the viewmodels akin to L4D, Garry's mod and CSGO with some slight differences and requirements.

## Using arms with weapons

As the transition from the old HL2 style v_models will take time, by default weapons do not have any arm models attached. To attach arms the associated weapon script requires a `default_arms` entry.

To specify different arms for different acts of the game there is: `snow_arms` for Act 2, `jacket_arms` for Act 3 and `camp_arms` for the Tutorial. If any of the act specific entries are absent or blank the model specified with `default_arms` will be used instead.

```
// Example using scripts/weapon_knife.txt
WeaponData
{
	"printname"	"#HDTF_KNIFE"
	"viewmodel"				"models/weapons/v_knife.mdl"
	"playermodel"			"models/weapons/w_knife.mdl"
    ...
    "default_arms"  "models/weapons/arms/v_arms_hecu.mdl"            // act 1
    "snow_arms"     "models/weapons/arms/v_arms_winter_survivor.mdl" // act 2
    "jacket_arms"   "models/weapons/arms/v_arms_coat.mdl"            // act 3
    "camp_arms"     "models/weapons/arms/v_arms_camp.mdl"            // tutorial
    ...
}
```

## Specifying arms per map

If a map needs to use a specific arm type it must be specified in the map itself. To do this open the map in Hammer, then on the Menu bar go to `Map` â†’ `Map Properties`, and change the option `Arms Skin` to the desired type.

```
"Arms Skin"
[    
    0 : "Default" - Marine outfit seen in Prologue & Act 1.
    1 : "Jacket" - black jacket with leather gloves seen in Act 3.
    2 : "Snow coat" - white coat seen in Act 2.
    3 : "Bare" - bare hands as seen in Tutorial level.
]
```

## Console Commands

- `cl_disable_arms` - Setting this to 1 will disable drawing the arm model.
- `hdtf_set_arms_type` - Setting this to a value from 0 to 3 will change the current arm type being used. Uses the same ordering found in the map properties setting.
